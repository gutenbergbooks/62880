that embodied in its declaration of absolute
freedom of expression, which makes for a range
broad enough to include every temperament from
the most radical to the most conservative, the only
requisite being that the work should have unmistakable
merit. Each issue will be devoted exclusively
to one individual, thereby giving him an opportunity
to present his work in sufficient bulk to
make it possible for the reader to obtain a much
more comprehensive grasp of his personality than is
afforded him in the restricted space allotted by the
other magazines. Published monthly, or more frequently
if possible, THE GLEBE will issue twelve
to twenty books per year, chosen on their merits
alone, since the subscription list does away with the
need of catering to the popular demand that confronts
every publisher. Thus, THE GLEBE can
promise the best work of American and foreign
authors, known and unknown.
</p>

<p>
The price of each issue of THE GLEBE will vary
with the cost of publication, but the yearly subscription,
including special numbers, is three dollars.

LOVE OF ONE&rsquo;S NEIGHBOR

</div>

<p>
<span class="hdr">Scene.</span> <span class="sd">A wild place in the mountains.</span>
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">A man in an attitude of despair is standing on a
tiny projection of a rock that rises almost sheer
from the ground. How he got there it is not easy to
say, but he cannot be reached either from above or
below. Short ladders, ropes and sticks show that
attempts have been made to save the unknown person,
but without success.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sd">It seems that the unhappy man has been in that
desperate position a long time. A considerable crowd
has already collected, extremely varied in composition.
There are venders of cold drinks; there is a
whole little bar behind which the bartender skips
about out of breath and perspiring&mdash;he has more
on his hands than he can attend to; there are peddlers
selling picture postal cards, coral beads, souvenirs,
and all sorts of trash. One fellow is stubbornly trying
to dispose of a tortoise-shell comb, which is
really not tortoise-shell. Tourists keep pouring in
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
from all sides, attracted by the report that a catastrophe
is impending&mdash;Englishmen, Americans, Germans,
Russians, Frenchmen, Italians, etc., with all
their peculiar national traits of character, manner
and dress. Nearly all carry alpenstocks, field-glasses
and cameras. The conversation is in different languages,
all of which, for the convenience of the
reader, we shall translate into English.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sd">At the foot of the rock where the unknown man
is to fall, two policemen are chasing the children
away and partitioning off a space, drawing a rope
around short stakes stuck in the ground. It is noisy
and jolly.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Get away, you loafer! The man&rsquo;ll
fall on your head and then your mother and father
will be making a hullabaloo about it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Boy.</span> Will he fall here?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Yes, here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Boy.</span> Suppose he drops farther?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Policeman.</span> The boy is right. He
may get desperate and jump, land beyond the rope
and hit some people in the crowd. I guess he weighs
at least about two hundred pounds.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Policeman.</span> Move on, move on, you!
Where are you going? Is that your daughter, lady?
Please take her away! The young man will soon
fall.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
<span class="speaker">Lady.</span> Soon? Did you say he is going to fall
soon? Oh, heavens, and my husband&rsquo;s not here!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Little Girl.</span> He&rsquo;s in the café, mamma.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady</span> (<span class="sd">desperately</span>). Yes, of course. He&rsquo;s always
in the café. Go call him, Nellie. Tell him the
man will soon drop. Hurry! Hurry!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> Waiter!&mdash;Garçon&mdash;Kellner&mdash;Three
beers out here!&mdash;No beer?&mdash;What?&mdash;Say, that&rsquo;s a
fine bar&mdash;We&rsquo;ll have some in a moment&mdash;Hurry
up&mdash;Waiter!&mdash;Waiter!&mdash;Garçon!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Policeman.</span> Say, boy, you&rsquo;re here again?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Boy.</span> I wanted to take the stone away.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> What for?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Boy.</span> So he shouldn&rsquo;t get hurt so badly when he
falls.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Policeman.</span> The boy is right. We
ought to remove the stone. We ought to clear the
place altogether. Isn&rsquo;t there any sawdust or sand
about?
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Two English tourists enter. They look at the
unknown man through field-glasses and exchange
remarks.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> He&rsquo;s young.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> How old?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> Twenty-eight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> Twenty-six. Fright has made
him look older.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> How much will you bet?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> Ten to a hundred. Put it
down.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">writing in his note-book. To
the policeman</span>). How did he got up there? Why
don&rsquo;t they take him off?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> They tried, but they couldn&rsquo;t. Our
ladders are too short.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> Has he been here long?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Two days.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> Aha! He&rsquo;ll drop at night.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> In two hours. A hundred to
a hundred.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> Put it down. (<span class="sd">He shouts to
the man on the rock.</span>) How are you feeling?
What? I can&rsquo;t hear you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">in a scarcely audible voice</span>).
Bad, very bad.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady.</span> Oh, heavens, and my husband is not
here!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Little Girl</span> (<span class="sd">running in</span>). Papa said he&rsquo;ll get
here in plenty of time. He&rsquo;s playing chess.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady.</span> Oh, heavens! Nellie, tell him he must
come. I insist. But perhaps I had rather&mdash; Will
he fall soon, Mr. Policeman? No? Nellie, you
go. I&rsquo;ll stay here and keep the place for papa.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">A tall, lanky woman of unusually independent
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
and military appearance and a tourist dispute for the
same place. The tourist, a short, quiet, rather weak
man, feebly defends his rights; the woman is resolute
and aggressive.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> But, lady, it is my place. I have been
standing here for two hours.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> What do I care how long
you have been standing here. I want this place. Do
you understand? It offers a good view, and that&rsquo;s
just what I want. Do you understand?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">weakly</span>). It&rsquo;s what I want, too.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> I beg your pardon, what
do you know about these things anyway?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> What knowledge is required? A man
will fall. That&rsquo;s all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman</span> (<span class="sd">mimicking</span>). &ldquo;A man will
fall. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Won&rsquo;t you have the goodness to
tell me whether you have ever seen a man fall?
No? Well, I did. Not one, but three. Two acrobats,
one rope-walker and three aeronauts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> That makes six.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman</span> (<span class="sd">mimicking</span>). &ldquo;That makes
six.&rdquo; Say, you are a mathematical prodigy. And
did you ever see a tiger tear a woman to pieces in a
zoo, right before your eyes? Eh? What? Yes,
exactly. Now, I did&mdash; Please! Please!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">The tourist steps aside, shrugging his shoulders
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
with an air of injury, and the tall woman triumphantly
takes possession of the stone she has won
by her prowess. She sits down, spreading out
around her her bag, handkerchiefs, peppermints,
and medicine bottle, takes off her gloves and wipes
her field-glass, glancing pleasantly on all around.
Finally she turns to the lady who is waiting for her
husband in the café.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman</span> (amiably). You will tire
yourself out, dear. Why don&rsquo;t you sit down?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady.</span> Oh, my, don&rsquo;t talk about it. My legs are
as stiff as that rock there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> Men are so rude nowadays.
They will never give their place to a woman.
Have you brought peppermints with you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady</span> (<span class="sd">frightened</span>). No. Why? Is it necessary?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> When you keep looking up
a long time you are bound to get sick. Sure thing.
Have you spirits of ammonia? No? Good gracious,
how thoughtless! How will they bring you
back to consciousness when he falls? You haven&rsquo;t
any smelling salts either, I dare say. Of course not.
Have you anybody to take care of you, seeing that
you are so helpless yourself?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady</span> (<span class="sd">frightened</span>). I will tell my husband. He
is in the café.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> Your husband is a brute.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Whose coat is this? Who threw
this rag here?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Boy.</span> It&rsquo;s mine. I spread my coat there so that
he doesn&rsquo;t hurt himself so badly when he falls.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Take it away.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Two tourists armed with cameras contending
for the same position.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> I wanted this place.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> You wanted it, but I got it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> You just came here. I have
had this place for two days.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> Then why did you go without
even leaving your shadow?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> I wasn&rsquo;t going to starve myself
to death.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Comb-Vender</span> (<span class="sd">mysteriously</span>). Tortoise-shell.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">savagely</span>). Well?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Vender.</span> Genuine tortoise-shell.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Go to the devil.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Third Tourist, Photographer.</span> For heaven&rsquo;s
sake, lady, you&rsquo;re sitting on my camera!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Little Lady.</span> Oh! Where is it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Under you, under you, lady.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Little Lady.</span> I am so tired. What a wretched
camera you have. I thought it felt uncomfortable
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
and I was wondering why. Now I know; I am
sitting on your camera.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">agonized</span>). Lady!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Little Lady.</span> I thought it was a stone. I saw
something lying there and I thought: A queer-looking
stone; I wonder why it&rsquo;s so black. So that&rsquo;s
what it was; it was your camera. I see.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">agonized</span>). Lady, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Little Lady.</span> Why is it so large, tell me.
Cameras are small, but this one is so large. I swear
I never had the faintest suspicion it was a camera.
Can you take my picture? I would so much like to
have my picture taken with the mountains here for a
background, in this wonderful setting.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> How can I take your picture if you
are sitting on my camera?

<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> Waiter, one beer!&mdash;What did you

<p>
<span class="speaker">Girl.</span> Here I am, papa.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Where in the world are you? (<span class="sd">He
turns around.</span>) Ah, there! What are you standing
back of me for? Look, look! For goodness sake,
where are you looking?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Girl</span> (<span class="sd">dismally</span>). I don&rsquo;t know, papa.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> No, that&rsquo;s impossible. Imagine! She
never once saw a lightning flash. She always keeps
her eyes open as wide as onions, but the instant it
flashes she closes them. So she never saw lightning,
not once. Mary, you are missing it again. There
it is! You see!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Student.</span> She sees, papa.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Keep an eye on her. (<span class="sd">Suddenly
dropping into tone of profound pity.</span>) Ah, poor
young man. Imagine! He&rsquo;ll fall from that high
rock. Look, children, see how pale he is! That
should be a lesson to you how dangerous climbing is.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Student</span> (<span class="sd">dismally</span>). He won&rsquo;t fall to-day,
papa!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Girl.</span> Papa, Mary has closed her eyes
again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Student.</span> Let us sit down, papa! Upon
my word, he won&rsquo;t fall to-day. The porter told me
so. I can&rsquo;t stand it any more. You&rsquo;ve been
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
dragging us about every day from morning till night
visiting art galleries.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> What&rsquo;s that? For whose benefit am
I doing this? Do you think I enjoy spending my
time with a dunce?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Girl.</span> Papa, Mary is blinking her eyes
again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Student.</span> I can&rsquo;t stand it either. I

the whole night long.

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Jimmie.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Student.</span> I have gotten so thin I am
nothing but skin and bones. I can&rsquo;t stand it any
more, father. I&rsquo;d rather be a farmer, or tend pigs.

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Aleck.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Student.</span> If he were really to fall&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s a fake. You believe every lie told you! They

<p>

to fall.

into the crowd. There is general commotion.
Voices, &ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s falling.&rdquo; Field-glasses are

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Ah, poor young man. Mary, Jimmie,
there&rsquo;s a tragedy for you. The sky is clear, the
weather is beautiful, and has he to fall and be shattered
to death? Can you realize how dreadful that
is, Aleck?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Student</span> (<span class="sd">wearily</span>). Yes, I can realize it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Mary, can you realize it? Imagine.
There is the sky. There are people enjoying themselves
and partaking of refreshments. Everything
is <a id="corr-1"></a>so nice and pleasant, and he has to fall. What a
tragedy! Do you remember Hamlet?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Girl</span> (<span class="sd">prompting</span>). Hamlet, Prince of
Denmark, of Alsinore.

me, father!

father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Comb-Vender</span> (<span class="sd">mysteriously</span>). Tortoise-shell.
Genuine tortoise-shell.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">credulously</span>). Stolen?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Vender.</span> Why, sir, the idea!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">angrily</span>). Do you mean to tell me it&rsquo;s
genuine if it isn&rsquo;t stolen? Go on. Not much.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman</span> (<span class="sd">amiably</span>). Are all these
your children?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Yes, madam. A father&rsquo;s duty. You
see, they are protesting. It is the eternal conflict
between fathers and children. Here is such a
tragedy going on, such a heart-rending tragedy&mdash;Mary,
you are blinking your eyes again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> You are quite right. Children
must be hardened to things. But why do you
call this a terrible tragedy? Every roofer, when he
falls, falls from a great height. But this here&mdash;what
is it? A hundred, two hundred feet. I saw a man
fall plumb from the sky.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">overwhelmed</span>). You don&rsquo;t say?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Aleck.</span> Children, listen. Plumb from the sky.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> Yes, yes. I saw an aeronaut
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
drop from the clouds and go crash upon an
iron roof.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> How terrible!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> That&rsquo;s what I call a tragedy.
It took two hours to bring me back to consciousness,
and all that time they pumped water on me, the
scoundrels. I was nearly drowned. From that day
on I never step out of the door without taking spirits
of ammonia with me.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Enter a strolling troop of Italian singers and
musicians: a short, fat tenor, with a reddish beard
and large, watery, stupidly dreamy eyes, singing
with extraordinary sweetness; a skinny humpback
with a jockey cap, and a screeching baritone; a bass
who is also a mandolinist, looking like a bandit; a
girl with a violin, closing her eyes when she plays,
so that only the whites are seen. They take their
stand and begin to sing: &ldquo;Sul mare luccica&mdash;Santa
Lucia, Santa Lucia&mdash;&rdquo;</span>)

<p>
<span class="speaker">Mary</span> (<span class="sd">dismally</span>). Papa, children, look. He is
beginning to wave his hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Is that the effect the music has upon
him?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> Quite possible. Music
usually goes with such things. But that&rsquo;ll make him
fall sooner than he should. Musicians, go away
from here! Go!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
(<span class="sd">A tall tourist, with up-curled mustache, violently
gesticulating, enters, followed by a small
group attracted by curiosity.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> It&rsquo;s scandalous. Why don&rsquo;t
they save him? Ladies and gentlemen, you all heard
him shout: &ldquo;Save me.&rdquo; Didn&rsquo;t you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">The Curious</span> (<span class="sd">in chorus</span>). Yes, yes, we heard
him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> There you are. I distinctly
heard these words: &ldquo;Save me! Why don&rsquo;t they
save me?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s scandalous. Policemen, policemen!
Why don&rsquo;t you save him? What are you doing
there?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policemen.</span> We are cleaning up the place for
him to fall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> That&rsquo;s a sensible thing to do,
too. But why don&rsquo;t you save him? You ought to
save him. If a man asks you to save him, it is absolutely
essential to save him. Isn&rsquo;t it so, ladies and
gentlemen?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">The Curious</span> (<span class="sd">in chorus</span>). True, absolutely
true. It is essential to save him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">with heat</span>). We are not
heathens, we are Christians. We should love our
neighbors. When a man asks to be saved every
measure which the government has at its command
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
should be taken to save him. Policeman, have you
taken every measure?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Every one!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> Every one without exception?
Gentleman, every measure has been taken. Listen,
young man, every measure has been taken to save
you. Did you hear?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">in a scarcely audible voice</span>).
Save me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">excitedly</span>). Gentlemen, did you
hear? He again asked to be saved. Policeman,
did you hear?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">One of the Curious</span> (<span class="sd">timidly</span>). It is my
opinion that it is absolutely necessary to save him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> That&rsquo;s right. Exactly. Why,
that&rsquo;s what I have been saying for the last two
hours. Policeman, do you hear? It is scandalous.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">One of the Curious</span> (<span class="sd">a little bolder</span>). It is my
opinion that an appeal should be made to the highest
authority.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">The Rest</span> (<span class="sd">in chorus</span>). Yes, yes, a complaint
should be made. It is scandalous. The government
ought not to leave any of its citizens in danger. We
all pay taxes. He must be saved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> Didn&rsquo;t I say so? Of course
we must put up a complaint. Young man! Listen,
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
young man. Do you pay taxes? What? I can&rsquo;t
hear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Jimmie, Katie, listen! What a
tragedy! Ah, the poor young man! He is soon to
fall and they ask him to pay a domiciliary tax.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Kate</span> (<span class="sd">the girl with glasses, pedantically</span>). That
can hardly be called a domicile, father. The meaning
of domicile is&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">James</span> (<span class="sd">pinching her</span>). Lickspittle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Mary</span> (<span class="sd">wearily</span>). Papa, children, look! He&rsquo;s
again beginning to fall.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">There is excitement in the crowd, and again a
bustling and shouting among the photographers.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> We must hurry, ladies and
gentlemen. He must be saved at any cost. Who&rsquo;s
going with me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">The Curious</span> (<span class="sd">in chorus</span>). We are all going!
We are all going?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> Policeman, did you hear?
Come, ladies and gentlemen!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">They depart, fiercely gesticulating. The café
grows more lively. The sound of clinking beer
glasses and the clatter of steins is heard, and the beginning
of a loud German song. The bartender, who
has forgotten himself while talking to somebody,
starts suddenly and runs off, looks up to the sky
with a hopeless air and wipes the perspiration from
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
his face with his napkin. Angry calls of Waiter!
Waiter!</span>)

me have some soda water?

at the man on the rock, and pretending not to have
heard him, walks away.</span>)

<p>
<span class="speaker">Many Voices.</span> Waiter! Beer!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Waiter.</span> One moment, one moment!

</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady.</span> Ah, there is my husband. Come here
quick.

<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> A downright brute.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Drunken Man</span> (<span class="sd">waving his hand to the unknown
man</span>). Say, is it very bad up there? Hey?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">rather loudly</span>). Yes, it&rsquo;s bad.
I am sick and tired of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Drunken Man.</span> Can&rsquo;t you get a drink?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man.</span> No, how can I?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Drunken Man.</span> Say, what are you
talking about? How can he get a drink? The man
is about to die and you tempt him and try to get
him excited. Listen, up there, we have been drinking
your health right along. It won&rsquo;t hurt you,
will it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Drunken Man.</span> Ah, go on! What are
you talking about? How can it hurt him? Why,
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
it will only do him good. It will encourage him.
Listen, honest to God, we are very sorry for you,
but don&rsquo;t mind us. We are going to the café to
have another drink. Good-bye.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Drunken Man.</span> Look, what a crowd.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Drunken Man.</span> Come, or he&rsquo;ll fall and
then they&rsquo;ll close the café.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Enter a new crowd of tourists, a very elegant
gentleman, the chief correspondent of European
newspapers at their head. He is followed by an
ecstatic whisper of respect and admiration. Many
leave the café to look at him, and even the waiter
turns slightly around, glances at him quickly, smiles
happily and continues on his way, spilling something
from his tray.</span>)
</p>

<p>

Look!

</p>

awful. The weather is so beautiful, and the chief
correspondent. Take out your note-book, Jimmie.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">James.</span> I lost it, father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent.</span> Where is he?

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices</span> (<span class="sd">obligingly</span>). There, there he is.

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent.</span> If you please, if you please,

<span class="speaker">Correspondent.</span> Thank you. (<span class="sd">Sits down.</span>)
Hm! What a situation! Very interesting. Very

</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Did you hear, Aleck? This smart

<span class="speaker">Obliging Voices.</span> It is quieter in the café.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">shouts to the unknown man</span>).
Permit me to introduce myself. I am the chief
correspondent of the European press. I have been
sent here at the special request of the editors. I
should like to ask you several questions concerning
your situation. What is your name? What is your
general position? How old are you? (<span class="sd">The unknown
man mumbles something.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">a little puzzled</span>). I can&rsquo;t hear
a thing. Has he been that way all the time?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> Yes, it&rsquo;s impossible to hear a word he
says.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">jotting down something in
his note-book</span>). Fine! Are you a bachelor? (<span class="sd">The
unknown man mumbles.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent.</span> I can&rsquo;t hear you. Are you
married? Yes?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> He said he was a bachelor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> No, he didn&rsquo;t. Of course,
he&rsquo;s married.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">carelessly</span>). You think so?
All right. We&rsquo;ll put down, married. How many
children have you? Can&rsquo;t hear! It seems to me
he said three. Hm! Anyway, we&rsquo;ll put down five.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Oh, my, what a tragedy. Five children!
Imagine!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> He is lying.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">shouting</span>). How did you get
into this position? What? I can&rsquo;t hear? Louder!
Repeat. What did you say? (<span class="sd">Perplexed, to the
crowd.</span>) What did he say? The fellow has a
devilishly weak voice.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist.</span> It seems to me he said that he
lost his way.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> No, he doesn&rsquo;t know himself
how he got there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> He was out hunting.&mdash;He was climbing
up the rocks.&mdash;No, no! He is simply a lunatic!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent.</span> I beg your pardon, I beg
your pardon, ladies and gentlemen! Anyway, he
didn&rsquo;t drop from the sky. However&mdash; (<span class="sd">He
quickly jots down in his note-book.</span>) Unhappy
young man&mdash;suffering from childhood with attacks
of lunacy.&mdash;The bright light of the full moon&mdash;the
wild rocks.&mdash;Sleepy janitor&mdash;didn&rsquo;t notice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">to the second, in a whisper</span>).
But it&rsquo;s new moon now.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Tourist.</span> Go, what does a layman
know about astronomy.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">ecstatically</span>). Mary, pay attention to
this! You have before you an ocular demonstration
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
of the influence of the moon on living organisms.
What a terrible tragedy to go out walking
on a moonlit night and find suddenly that you have
climbed to a place whence it is impossible to climb
down or be taken down.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">shouting</span>). What feelings
are you experiencing? I can&rsquo;t hear. Louder! Ah,
so? Well, well! What a situation!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Crowd</span> (<span class="sd">interested</span>). Listen, listen! Let&rsquo;s
hear what his feelings are. How terrible!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">writes in his note-book, tossing
out detached remarks</span>). Mortal terror numbs
his limbs.&mdash;A cold shiver goes down his spinal
column.&mdash;No hope.&mdash;Before his mental vision rises
a picture of family bliss: Wife making sandwiches;
his five children innocently lisping their love.&mdash;Grandma
in the arm-chair with a tube to her ear,
that is, grandpa in the arm-chair, with a tube to <em>his</em>
ear and grandma.&mdash;Deeply moved by the sympathy
of the public.&mdash;His last wish before his death that
the words he uttered with his last breath should be
published in our newspapers&mdash;

<span class="speaker">Military Woman</span> (<span class="sd">indignantly</span>). My! He
lies like a salesman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Mary</span> (<span class="sd">wearily</span>). Papa, children, look, he is
starting to fall again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">angrily</span>). Don&rsquo;t bother me. Such a
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
tragedy is unfolding itself right before your very
eyes&mdash;and you&mdash; What are you making such big
eyes for again?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">shouting</span>). Hold on fast.
That&rsquo;s it! My last question: What message do you
wish to leave for your fellow citizens before you
depart for the better world?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man.</span> That they may all go to the
devil.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent.</span> What? Hm, yes&mdash; (<span class="sd">He
writes quickly.</span>) Ardent love&mdash;is a stanch opponent
of the law granting equal rights to negroes.
His last words: &ldquo;Let the black niggers&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor</span> (<span class="sd">out of breath, pushing through the
crowd</span>). Where is he? Ah, there! Poor young
man. Has there been no clergyman here yet? No?
Thank you. Am I the first?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">writes</span>). A touching dramatic
moment.&mdash;A minister has arrived.&mdash;All are
trembling on the verge of suspense. Many are
shedding tears&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor.</span> Excuse me, excuse me! Ladies and
gentlemen, a lost soul wishes to make its peace with
God&mdash; (<span class="sd">He shouts.</span>) My son, don&rsquo;t you wish to
make your peace with God? Confess your sins to
me. I will grant you remission at once! What?
I cannot hear?
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">writes</span>). The air is shaken
with the people&rsquo;s groans. The minister of the
church exhorts the criminal, that is, the unfortunate
man, in touching language.&mdash;The unfortunate
creature with tears in his eyes thanks him in a faint
voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">faintly</span>). If you won&rsquo;t go
away I will jump on your head. I weigh three
hundred pounds. (<span class="sd">All jump away frightened behind
each other.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> He is falling! He is falling!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">agitatingly</span>). Mary, Aleck, Jimmie.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman</span> (<span class="sd">energetically</span>). Clear the place,
please! Move on!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Lady.</span> Nellie, go quick and tell your father he
is falling.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Photographer</span> (<span class="sd">in despair</span>). Oh my, I am
out of films (<span class="sd">tosses madly about, looking pitifully
at the unknown man</span>). One minute, I&rsquo;ll go and get
them. I have some in my overcoat pocket over
there. (<span class="sd">He walks a short distance, keeping his eyes
fixed on the unknown man, and then returns.</span>) I
can&rsquo;t, I am afraid I&rsquo;ll miss it. Good heavens! They
are over there in my overcoat. Just one minute,
please. I&rsquo;ll fetch them right away. What a fix.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor.</span> Hurry, my friend. Pull yourself together
and try to hold out long enough to tell me
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
at least your principal sins. You needn&rsquo;t mention
the lesser ones.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> What a tragedy?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">writes</span>). The criminal, that
is, the unhappy man, makes a public confession and
does penance. Terrible secrets revealed. He is a
bank robber&mdash;blew up safes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">credulously</span>). The scoundrel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor</span> (<span class="sd">shouts</span>). In the first place, have you
killed? Secondly, have you stolen? Thirdly, have
you committed adultery?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Mary, Jimmie, Katie, Aleck, Charlie,
close your ears.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">writing</span>). Tremendous excitement
in the crowd.&mdash;Shouts of indignation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor</span> (<span class="sd">hurriedly</span>). Fourthly, have you blasphemed?
Fifthly, have you coveted your neighbor&rsquo;s
ass, his ox, his slave, his wife? Sixthly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Photographer</span> (<span class="sd">alarmed</span>). Ladies and gentlemen,
an ass!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Photographer.</span> Where? I can&rsquo;t see
it!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Photographer</span> (<span class="sd">calmed</span>). I thought I heard
it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor.</span> I congratulate you, my son! I congratulate
you! You have made your peace with
God. Now you may rest easy&mdash;Oh, God, what do
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
I see? The Salvation Army! Policeman, chase
them away!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">Enter a Salvation Army band, men and women
in uniforms. There are only three instruments, a
drum, a violin and a piercingly shrill trumpet.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Salvation Army Man</span> (<span class="sd">frantically beating his
drum and shouting in a nasal voice</span>). Brethren and
sisters&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor</span> (<span class="sd">shouting even louder in a still more
nasal voice in an effort to drown the other&rsquo;s</span>). He
has already confessed. Bear witness, ladies and
gentlemen, that he has confessed and made his peace
with heaven.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Salvation Army Woman</span> (<span class="sd">climbing on a rock
and shrieking</span>). I once wandered in the dark just
as this sinner and I lived a bad life and was a drunkard,
but when the light of truth&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">A Voice.</span> Why, she is drunk now.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor.</span> Policeman, didn&rsquo;t he confess and
make his peace with heaven?
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">The Salvation Army man continues to beat his
drum frantically; the rest begin to drawl a song.
Shouts, laughter, whistling. Singing in the café,
and calls of &ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; in all languages. The bewildered
policemen tear themselves away from the
pastor, who is pulling them somewhere; the photographers
turn and twist about as if the seats
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
were burning under them. An English lady comes
riding in on a donkey, who, stopping suddenly,
sprawls out his legs and refuses to go farther, adding
his noise to the rest. Gradually the noise subsides.
The Salvation Army band solemnly withdraws, and
the pastor, waving his hands, follows them.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First English Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">to the other</span>). How
impolite! This crowd doesn&rsquo;t know how to behave
itself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second English Tourist.</span> Come, let&rsquo;s go
away from here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First English Tourist.</span> One minute. (<span class="sd">He
shouts.</span>) Listen, won&rsquo;t you hurry up and fall?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second English Tourist.</span> What are you saying,
Sir William?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First English Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">shouting</span>). Don&rsquo;t
you see that&rsquo;s what they are waiting for? As a
gentleman you should grant them this pleasure and
so escape the humiliation of undergoing tortures
before this mob.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second English Tourist.</span> Sir William.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">ecstatically</span>). See? It&rsquo;s true. Aleck,
Jimmie, it&rsquo;s true. What a tragedy!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Several Tourists</span> (<span class="sd">going for the Englishman</span>).
How dare you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">First English Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">shoving them aside</span>).
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
Hurry up and fall! Do you hear? If you haven&rsquo;t
the backbone I&rsquo;ll help you out with a pistol shot.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> That red-haired devil has gone clear
out of his mind.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman</span> (<span class="sd">seizing the Englishman&rsquo;s hand</span>).
You have no right to do it, it&rsquo;s against the law. I&rsquo;ll
arrest you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Some Tourists.</span> A barbarous nation!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">The unknown man shouts something. Excitement
below.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> Hear, hear, hear!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">aloud</span>). Take that jackass
away to the devil. He wants to shoot me. And
tell the boss that I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> What&rsquo;s that? What boss? He is
losing his mind, the poor man.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Aleck! Mary! This is a mad scene.
Jimmie, you remember Hamlet? Quick.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">angrily</span>). Tell him my
spinal column is broken.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Mary</span> (<span class="sd">wearily</span>). Papa, children, he&rsquo;s beginning
to kick with his legs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Kate.</span> Is that what is called convulsions, papa?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">rapturously</span>). I don&rsquo;t know. I think
it is. What a tragedy?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Aleck</span> (<span class="sd">glumly</span>). You fool! You keep cramming
and cramming and you don&rsquo;t know that the
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
right name for that is agony. And you wear eye-glasses,
too. I can&rsquo;t bear it any longer, papa.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Think of it, children. A man is
about to fall down to his death and he is bothering
about his spinal column.
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">There is a noise. A man in a white vest, very
much frightened, enters, almost dragged by angry
tourists. He smiles, bows on all sides, stretches out
his arms, now running forward as he is pushed, now
trying to escape in the crowd, but is seized and
pulled again.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> A bare-faced deception! It is an outrage.
Policeman, policeman, he must be taught a
lesson!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Other Voices.</span> What is it? What deception?
What is it all about? They have caught a thief!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">The Man in the White Vest</span> (<span class="sd">bowing and
smiling</span>). It&rsquo;s a joke, ladies and gentlemen, a joke,
that&rsquo;s all. The people were bored, so I wanted to
provide a little amusement for them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">angrily</span>). Boss!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">The Man in the White Vest.</span> Wait a
while, wait a while.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man.</span> Do you expect me to stay
here until the Second Advent? The agreement was
till twelve o&rsquo;clock. What time is it now?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist</span> (<span class="sd">indignantly</span>). Do you hear,
<a id="page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a>
ladies and gentlemen? This scoundrel, this man
here in the white vest hired that other scoundrel up
there and just simply tied him to the rock.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> Is he tied?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> Yes, he is tied and he can&rsquo;t
fall. We are excited and worrying, but he couldn&rsquo;t
fall even if he tried.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man.</span> What else do you want? Do
you think I am going to break my neck for your
measly ten dollars? Boss, I can&rsquo;t stand it any
more. One man wanted to shoot me. The pastor
preached me for two hours. This is not in the
agreement.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Aleck.</span> Father, I told you that Baedecker lies.
You believe everything anybody tells you and drag
us about without eating.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Man in the White Vest.</span> The people were
bored. My only desire was to amuse the people.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> What is the matter? I
don&rsquo;t understand a thing. Why isn&rsquo;t he going to
fall? Who, then, is going to fall?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> I don&rsquo;t understand a thing either.
Of course he&rsquo;s got to fall!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">James.</span> You never understand anything,
father. Weren&rsquo;t you told that he&rsquo;s tied to the rock?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Aleck.</span> You can&rsquo;t convince him. He loves
every Baedecker more than his own children.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
<span class="speaker">James.</span> A nice father!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Silence!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> What is the matter? He
must fall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> The idea! What a deception.
You&rsquo;ll have to explain this.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Man in the White Vest.</span> The people were
bored. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but wishing
to accommodate you&mdash;give you a few hours of
pleasant excitement&mdash;elevate your spirits&mdash;inspire
you with altruistic sentiments&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Englishman.</span> Is the café yours?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Man in the White Vest.</span> Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Englishman.</span> And is the hotel below also
yours?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Gentleman.</span> Yes. The people were bored&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Correspondent</span> (<span class="sd">writing</span>). The proprietor of
the café, desiring to increase his profits from the
sale of alcoholic beverages, exploits the best human
sentiments.&mdash;The people&rsquo;s indignation&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">angrily</span>). Boss, will you
have me taken off at once or won&rsquo;t you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Hotel Keeper.</span> What do you want up there?
Aren&rsquo;t you satisfied? Didn&rsquo;t I have you taken off
at night?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man.</span> Well, I should say so. You
think I&rsquo;d be hanging here nights, too!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
<span class="speaker">Hotel Owner.</span> Then you can stand it a few
minutes longer. The people are bored&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> Say, have you any idea of
what you have done? Do you realize the enormity
of it? You are scoundrels, who for your own
sordid personal ends have impiously exploited the
finest human sentiment, love of one&rsquo;s neighbor.
You have caused us to undergo fear and suffering.
You have poisoned our hearts with pity. And now,
what is the upshot of it all? The upshot is that this
scamp, your vile accomplice, is bound to the rock
and not only will he not fall as everybody expects,
but he <em>can&rsquo;t</em>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> What is the matter? He
has got to fall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Policeman! Policeman!
</p>

<p>
(<span class="sd">The pastor enters, out of breath.</span>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor.</span> What? Is he still living? Oh, there
he is! What fakirs those Salvationists are.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Voices.</span> Don&rsquo;t you know that he is bound?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor.</span> Bound! Bound to what? To life?
Well, we are all bound to life until death snaps the
cord. But whether he is bound or not bound, I reconciled
him with heaven, and that&rsquo;s enough. But
those fakirs&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Policeman! Policeman, you must
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
draw up an official report. There is no way out
of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman</span> (<span class="sd">going for the hotel owner</span>).
I will not allow myself to be fooled. I saw an
aeronaut drop from the clouds and go crash upon
a roof. I saw a tiger tear a woman to pieces&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Photographer.</span> I spoiled three films photographing
that scamp. You will have to answer for
this, sir. I will hold you responsible.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> An official report! An official report!
Such a bare-faced deception. Mary, Jimmie,
Aleck, Charlie, call a policeman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Hotel Keeper</span> (<span class="sd">drawing back, in despair</span>).
But, I can&rsquo;t make him fall if he doesn&rsquo;t want to. I
did everything in my power, ladies and gentlemen!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Military Woman.</span> I will not allow it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Hotel Keeper.</span> Excuse me. I promise you
on my word of honor that the next time he will
fall. But he doesn&rsquo;t want to, to-day.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man.</span> What&rsquo;s that? What did you
say about the next time?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Hotel Keeper.</span> You shut up there!
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man.</span> For ten dollars?
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Pastor.</span> Pray, what impudence! I just made
his peace with heaven when he was in danger of
his life. You have heard him threatening to fall on
my head, haven&rsquo;t you? And still he is dissatisfied.

<p>
<span class="speaker">Photographer</span> (<span class="sd">calmed</span>). I thought I heard
one.

<p>
<span class="speaker">Second Photographer.</span> It is you who are an
ass. I have become cross-eyed on account of your
shouting: &ldquo;An ass! An ass!&rdquo;

<span class="speaker">Mary</span> (<span class="sd">wearily</span>). Papa, children, look! A
policeman is coming.

pulling a policeman, on the other the hotel keeper;
both keep crying: &ldquo;Excuse me! Excuse me!&rdquo;</span>)

<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Excuse me, excuse me, ladies and
gentlemen. We will bring him to his senses in
short order and make him confess.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Hotel Keeper.</span> I can&rsquo;t make him fall if he
doesn&rsquo;t want to.
</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman.</span> Hey, you, young man out there!
Can you fall or can&rsquo;t you? Confess!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
<span class="speaker">Unknown Man</span> (<span class="sd">sullenly</span>). I don&rsquo;t want to

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tall Tourist.</span> Write down what I dictate,

<p>
<span class="speaker">Tourist.</span> Listen children, they are drawing up

</p>

<p>
<span class="speaker">Policeman</span> (<span class="sd">writing with painful effort, his

<p>
<span class="speaker">The Man Carrying the Pole</span> (<span class="sd">stopping and

the day of my birth and for a long time thereafter.
That miserable growth, which in my tenth

year covered my scalp was more like wool than real
hair. When I was married my skull was as bare
as a pillow and my young bride&mdash;

that is, children?

POETRY
</p>

<p class="ads">
A MAGAZINE OF VERSE
</p>

<p class="c">
Edited by Harriet Monroe, 543 Cass St., Chicago, Ill.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY, at the end of its first year, is no longer an experiment
but an assured artistic success, a publication whose
importance is authoritatively recognized, not only in this
country, but in Great Britain and France as well. The
field it has opened up is full of brilliant possibilities, encouraging
the editors to hope for the enthusiastic support
of a discriminating public.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY endeavors to present the best verse now being
written in English, quality alone being the test of acceptance.
</p>

<p class="hang">
POETRY is an effort to create an organ for the art. While
the ordinary magazines must minister to a large public
little interested in poetry, this magazine appeals to and
will develop a public primarily interested in poetry as
an art, potentially the highest, most complete human expression
of truth and beauty. Thus it offers to poets a
chance to be heard by their own audience, in their own
place, without the limitations imposed by the popular
magazines. And to lovers of poetry it offers each month
a sheaf of new verse in delicate form uninterrupted by
prose articles demanding a different mood.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
